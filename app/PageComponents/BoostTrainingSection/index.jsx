        <p className="xsm:text-[16px] text-[14px] text-center">
          employees today disengage quickly because traditional videos just
          aren’t cutting it anymore. Even a 5-minute video can feel endless in a
          world filled with quick, attention-grabbing content like Instagram
          Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts. With ever-shrinking attention
          spans, it’s crucial to rethink how learning content is delivered.
          That’s where chaabi comes in. Our platform enables you to add
          strategically placed questions and interactive elements to your
          videos, ensuring employees are not just watching but actively
          learning. This approach helps confirm that they’re retaining the
          information you need them to know. Isn’t that amazing? But it gets
          even better. Imagine if one video could adapt to the unique needs of
          different employees. For example, a professional with 10 years of
          experience doesn’t need to sit through an explanation of basic Excel
          skills, right? Meanwhile, a new hire might be unfamiliar with key
          terms like "KPIs," which your organization uses daily. With chaabi’s
          Tooltip feature, you can seamlessly bridge this gap. Embedded prompts
          explain terms, offer extra resources, or link to additional content.
          This way, experienced employees can skip what they already know, while
          new hires receive the guidance they need—without disrupting the flow
          of the content. It's personalized and efficient, ensuring every
          learner gets the most out of your training.

        But here’s the problem: Passive learning doesn’t cut it anymore. When
        employees simply watch a video without any interaction, they might
        temporarily absorb the information, but without engagement, it rarely
        sticks. Critical concepts are missed, and performance suffers as a
        result. That’s why active learning is essential. With chaabi, employees
        don’t just watch—they participate. Embedded questions and prompts
        throughout the video keep them on their toes, ensuring they not only
        understand but also retain the material. Real-time feedback reinforces
        key concepts, creating a deeper learning experience that leads to better
        retention and application in the workplace. Now, let’s take this one
        step further: What if employees could learn in the language they
        understand best? Did you know: Unilever, a global consumer goods
        company, operates in more than 190 countries, with large offices in
        India and Latin America. With over 150,000 employees worldwide, they may
        face a challenge of delivering consistent, high-quality training across
        diverse regions and languages.

      <div className="w-[372px] xsm:w-[688px] lg:w-[860px] mx-auto flex flex-col gap-[10px] md:text-start text-center">
        Using chaabi would be a game-changer for such organisations. By
        uploading multiple audio tracks of various languages in a single video,
        they could offer the same content across the globe, having employees
        choose their preferred language. This makes the content more relatable,
        boosts engagement, and ensures that all employees—regardless of
        location—receive the same high standard of training. The result?
        Increased productivity, higher engagement, and faster learning. By
        delivering dynamic, interactive training tailored to your employee’s
        language, experience and learning acumen. Ready to transform your
        training content? With chaabi, you can make learning engaging,
        impactful, and perfectly suited to the diverse needs of your workforce
